# What is Design Pattern ?
    - Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of 
    the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it
    the same way twice.

    - In general, a pattern has four essential elements:

      * The **pattern name** is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or
        two. Naming a pattern immediately increases our design vocabulary. It lets us design at a higher level of abstraction.

      * The **problem** describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its context. It might describes specific
        design problems such as how to represent algorithms as objects. It might describe class or object structures that are symptomatic of an inflexible design.

      * The **solution** describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. The solution doesn't describe  particular concrete design or implementation, because a pattern like a template that can be applied in many different situations.

      * The **consequences** are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. Though consequences are often unvoiced when we describe design decisions, they are critical for evaluating design alternatives and for understanding the costs and benefits of applying the pattern
